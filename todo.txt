The heuristic solver is spitting out results :D
However, the consistency is probably not correct. We need to make sure that trips cannot be performed before their previous dependence has been done. 
I got stuck when it created empty lists of candidate trips to perform, since no action was valid? weird...

Well, once a drone has set on a hub, it will get stuck if all the trips from that hub rely on other hubs... So maybe that's it. ANyway it's late and time to go to bed.

Don't worry, new day new Freek!

When a trip get's selected for a drone, it cannot immediately be marked as "finished". Another drone might then take the next
trip thinking the previous has already been delivered in the last drone's sequence.
